Please do not push a code with main definition. The mainfile.cpp already has a main definition. That will generate conflicts with another main defintion(s) while compiling all source codes together. Expand or edit existing codes if you want. Do not code abruptly in the file, code in modules and use that module wherever necessary.  Tushar and Patni please add your code to a seperate folder and then push to this repo. Your cpp files should not get mixed with cpp's of this module. <br>
